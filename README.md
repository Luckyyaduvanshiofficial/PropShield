# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

To start the app, in your terminal run:

```bash
npm run start
```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in:

- [a development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [an Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [an iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Workflows

This project is configured to use [EAS Workflows](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/workflows/get-started/) to automate some development and release processes. These commands are set up in [`package.json`](./package.json) and can be run using NPM scripts in your terminal.

### Previews

Run `npm run draft` to [publish a preview update](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/workflows/examples/publish-preview-update/) of your project, which can be viewed in Expo Go or in a development build.

### Development Builds

Run `npm run development-builds` to [create a development build](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/workflows/examples/create-development-builds/). Note - you'll need to follow the [Prerequisites](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/workflows/examples/create-development-builds/#prerequisites) to ensure you have the correct emulator setup on your machine.

### Production Deployments

Run `npm run deploy` to [deploy to production](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/workflows/examples/deploy-to-production/). Note - you'll need to follow the [Prerequisites](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/workflows/examples/deploy-to-production/#prerequisites) to ensure you're set up to submit to the Apple and Google stores.

## Hosting

Expo offers hosting for websites and API functions via EAS Hosting. See the [Getting Started](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/hosting/get-started/) guide to learn more.


## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
